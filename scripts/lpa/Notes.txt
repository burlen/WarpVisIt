./WarpVisIt.sh -np=4  --warp-script=/Users/oruebel/Devel/WarpVisIt/scripts/lpa_jan2014/lpa_twocolor_visit.py --visit-install=/Users/oruebel/Devel/visit/install --interactive --sim2-file=/Users/oruebel/Devel/testLPAtwocolor.sim2

Status:
------
- I was able to run the sim with VisIt and have VisIt tell the simulation to step, run, pause and kill
- Plotting results from the simulation in VisIt seemed to yield empty plots in most cases. Need to investigate why (e.g., is this a 2D vs. 3D issue in the interface classes?)
- For the grid, I was able to plot the grid itself, an expression of procid (looked correct),  rho (all 0's), and rank (all 3's). All other variales returned empty plots.
- For the particles I was not able to plot the mesh or any of the variables
- I did not receive any errors on the VisIt end (aside from warnings that the plots are empty). On the sim side I received the following types of messages:

VariableData's number of tuples must be greater than 0.
The data array does not contain any data
Error: 0 Warp failed to produce phi


Notes:
------
- It looks like in the script we have fixed number of steps, rather than the dynamically changing steps.
  Should we use 
       step(nint(560/dtcoef*float(nzplambda)/16))
  as max number of steps rather than step(3001*280) that is currently used?
- The use of global variables is problematic. Had to identify and declare all variables that
  were used in a global scope in the setup script
- Added option to disable the adding of the liveplots function to disable plots from Warp
