export PATH=/Users/oruebel/Devel/Libraries/pyMPI:$PATH
./WarpVisIt.sh -np=4  --warp-script=/Users/oruebel/Devel/WarpVisIt/scripts/lpa_jan2014/lpa_twocolor_visit.py --visit-install=/Users/oruebel/Devel/visit/install --interactive --sim2-file=/Users/oruebel/Devel/testLPAtwocolor.sim2


- It looks like in the script we have fixed number of steps, rather than the dynamically changing steps.
  Should we use 
       step(nint(560/dtcoef*float(nzplambda)/16))
  as max number of steps rather than step(3001*280) that is currently used?
- The use of global variables is problematic. Had to identify and declare all variables that
  were used in a global scope in the setup script
- Added option to disable the adding of the liveplots function to disable plots from Warp
