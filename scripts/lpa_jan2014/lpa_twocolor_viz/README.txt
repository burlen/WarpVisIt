Please find attached an archive file that contains a python input script (lpa_twocolor.py), a few other associated scripts and a batch script (runbatch).

This is running a new scheme of injection for very high quality beams in laser plasma acceleration stages. 

You can lower the resolution of the grid (which automatically raises the time steps and lowers the number of macroparticles) by lowering the values of the variables nx and nzplambda at lines 253 and 255 in lpa_twocolor.py.

Once you get it to run, we can discuss which quantities should be visualized.

Let me know if you have questions.
